# Sorting-Algorithm-Analysis
Defines sorting algorithms from scratch such as bubble sort, merge sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.  Times and tests them with integer lists of size 1k, 10k, and 100k.  Also tests for edge cases, for example, quicksort where the pivot element is at an extreme.
